# NODEJS_PROJECTS
This repository contains a collection of projects that I built while learning Node.js. The projects are a mix of simple and complex, and they cover a variety of topics, including web development, API development, and data manipulation. The code in the projects is not perfect, as I am still learning Node.js. However, I am always open to feedback
